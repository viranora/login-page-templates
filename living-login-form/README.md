<br>

A sophisticated and subtly animated login form component, designed as part of Nora's UI Gallery â€“ a collection showcasing advanced frontend experiments. This component focuses on creating an ambient and interactive user experience using glassmorphism, fluid background animations, and precise micro-interactions.

It demonstrates how standard form elements can be elevated through thoughtful animation and state-driven visual feedback.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Glassmorphism Card:** A frosted glass effect card using Tailwind CSS (`backdrop-blur`, opacity).
* **Ambient Background:** Soft, animated blobs (`AnimatedBlob.jsx`) that slowly morph and shift in the background using Framer Motion.
* **Reactive Background Colors:** The background blobs subtly change color (`transition-colors`) based on the validity of the email input (using React `useMemo`).
* **Animated Input Labels:** The input labels (`AnimatedInput.jsx`) animate upwards character by character (`staggerChildren`) when the input is focused or has value.
* **Animated Lock Icon:** A lock icon smoothly transitions between `LockClosedIcon` and `LockOpenIcon` (`AnimatePresence`, `@heroicons/react`) based on password field focus.
* **Animated Button State:** The submit button transitions gracefully into a loading spinner (`AnimatePresence`) during the simulated submission process.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

* **Core:** React.js
* **Animation:** Framer Motion
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Icons:** Heroicons (`@heroicons/react/24/solid`)
