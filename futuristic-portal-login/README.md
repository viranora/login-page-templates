# Futuristic Portal Login - Nora's UI Gallery Component

<br>



<br>

A minimalist, tech-inspired login screen component featuring an "opening portal" animation. Designed as part of Nora's UI Gallery, this experiment explores entrance animations, sleek UI elements, and a futuristic aesthetic.

The core interaction involves two panels sliding open to reveal the login form, creating a sense of accessing a secure system.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Opening Portal Animation:** Utilizes Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` and `exit` variants to animate two panels sliding outwards, revealing the form underneath.
* **Futuristic Aesthetic:** Employs a dark theme, neon blue accents (`neon-blue` color), minimalist typography, and subtle glass effects (`backdrop-blur`).
* **Staggered Form Reveal:** Once the "portal" opens, the form elements (title, inputs, button) appear sequentially with a subtle fade-in and upward motion (`staggerChildren`).
* **Minimalist Inputs:** Features custom `FuturisticInput.jsx` components with placeholder text and a neon blue focus effect (border and subtle glow).
* **Animated Show/Hide Password:** Includes an animated eye icon for toggling password visibility within the `FuturisticInput`.
* **Clean Button Interaction:** A simple, border-based button with a neon blue hover/active state and a clean loading spinner animation.
