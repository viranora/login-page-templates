üé® About This Gallery

Hi, I'm Nora. üëã I believe frontend development is not just about functionality, but also about crafting delightful and memorable user experiences. This gallery serves as my personal space to experiment with cutting-edge UI techniques, fluid animations, and unique micro-interactions, primarily using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Each component or "experiment" in this gallery is designed to be visually appealing, highly interactive, and demonstrate a specific frontend concept or animation technique.

üöÄ Technologies Used

Core: React.js, Vite

Animation: Framer Motion

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Routing: React Router v6

Icons: Heroicons
